    <p><strong>Johann Sebastian Bach</strong> lived from <em>1685-1750</em>. Bach is one of the most prolific <strong>Baroque</strong> era composers. He is most well known for his work with 4 part harmonies, fugues, and counterpoint. Bach wrote countless pieces most of which were revolutionary for his time and are regarded as masterpieces. Fun fact Bach had 20 children!
</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The Baroque Era</strong> in music lasted from approximately <em>1600-1750</em>. Baroque music has a few key features such as long flowing melodic lines, littered with ornimentation, trills, and turns. Additionally baroque music played with contrasting dynamics <strong>LOUD</strong> and <em>soft</em> often pitting these opposites against eachother to get the most from their juxtaposition. One of the most notible things in this era was the use of contrapuntal textures which saw more than one melodic line occur at the same time. All of these features wrapped up in time appropriate instrumentation and an emphasis on musician's abilities rather than compositional ingenuity. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</strong> lived from <em>1756-1791</em>. Mozart was one of the most prolific <strong>Classical</strong> era composers. He is most well known for his work with piano music such as concertos minuets and sonata's. Mozart was praised as a genius writing his first well known <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6mP4Vo2uvo&t=33s"> <strong><em>Minuet in G</em></strong></a> when he was just 5 years old! Little fun fact about mozart is that he was definitely a party animal!</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The Classical Era</strong> in music lasted from approximately <em>1730-1820</em>. Classical music has a few key features such as an emphasis on simplicity. tonal harmony, and single-line melodies. This is a radical departure from the chaos that is sometimes in Baroque music. You can hear short concise phrases almost always going from aa question phrase to an answer phrase in 4 measure incraments. This era was focused on refining the artform and making everything sound nice and perfect.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Ludwing Van Beethoven</strong> lived from <em>1770-1827</em>. Beethoven was one of the most prolific <strong>Romantic</strong> era composers. Actually beethoven was the first Romantic era composer with his <a> href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkP33esCi5g" Eroica symphony (Symphony number 3)</a>. Beethoven had 3 distinct period in his life. When he was younger he was a renounded classical composer. Than he transitioned to a Romantic style and later in life when he lost his hearing he wrote much more introspective pieces based on more complex theory.
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Romantic Era</strong> in music lasted from approximately <em>1805-1900</em>. Romantic era music is very <strong>DRAMATIC</strong>. It breaks free of some design contrants of the classical era in favor of more expression. Longer melodies, drastic dynamics, intense energy and passion are all traits of this era. This era called for even larger ensembles, larger instrumentations, and massive feats of compositional prowes. Dissonance is another important trait in romantic era music. Composers no longer needed everything to sound perfect but rather wanted to express emotions and feelings through their art.
